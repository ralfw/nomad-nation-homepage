What's Nomad Nation about? We're thinking about that constantly. Hey, we're a start-up always on the lookout for the next opportunity to pivot ![ðŸ˜ƒ](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/taa/1.5/16/1f603.png)

Ok, more seriously: No, we're not looking for a pivot, but we're aware it can always happen. It can happen because new data comes to light or because we refine our understanding of our own motivation. This is a co-evolution between us, the company, and the market.

And our latest "revelation" has been... Nomad Nation is about the *homebase*.

Yes, we're addressing solopreneurs. More specifically global solopreneurs aka digital nomads.

But not every global solopreneur will find a benefit in Nomad Nation (yet). It's just the solopreneurs who want to "settle down", who want to find a *homebase*.

There are probably as many types of digital nomads as there as digital nomads ![ðŸ˜‰](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tb0/1.5/16/1f609.png) However, we think two patterns can be identified:

- The digital nomad constantly travelling and being very happy with that. "Settling down" hasn't occurred to her (yet) - and she's keeping her business somewhere, often in her country of citizenship (or maybe in Delaware?). It's just the (seemingly) easiest way to do it.

- The digital nomad who has travelled a lot and wants to continue doing it - but who also feels some desire to slow down and set up a base somewhere. This base is where he can return to and build some deeper connections, store some stuff and set up his business at. Preferrably this homebase is located in a country where the expenses for it and the business are low.

Nomad Nation squarely focusses on the second type of digital nomad. And we're starting with Bulgaria as our suggestion for a hosting country for a digital nomad homebase because, well, it's beautiful here and on top of that the cost of living is low and the taxes are low.

"It's the homebase, silly!" that could be our slogan ![ðŸ˜‰](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tb0/1.5/16/1f609.png)

So, if you're a digital nomad looking for a homebase, then Nomad Nation is here to help. Currently serving digital nomads in Bulgaria - but sooner or later (hopefully) elsewhere...

Our understanding of a homebase is not, that it's the place were you grow old and die ![ðŸ˜‰](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tb0/1.5/16/1f609.png) ![ðŸ˜ƒ](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/taa/1.5/16/1f603.png) But it's a place to which - at least for a couple of years - you create stronger ties and like to return to. It's more than just the next destination or a cheap place to dump stuff. No, emotional bonds grow, the understanding of it becomes deeper than usual, and it is actually a base to start "expeditions" into the world from.

For "ordinary people" this homebase usually is some place in their home country. But digital nomads feel more independent and adventurous! Hence they are open to find a homebase anywhere in the world.

Therefore we don't view digital nomads as citizens of a territorial country anymore, but citizens of a nation of nomads: Nomad Nation. And we want to support them to feel at home in the world where they feel drawn to.
