What does a homebase costs? At Nomad Nation we distinguish between:

- **Setup** costs or 1-time costs

- **Running** costs

Both types of costs are relevant for the personal and business side of your homebase:

- **Personal life**: You need to find accommodation (running costs), you need to get residency (setup costs).
- **Business life**: Setting up a business will produce costs depending on the way you want to run it. The most expensive option is a fully fledged company of your own. And after your have got your business registered and all, there are running costs for the tax accountant. (Also you might want to view taxes and social security payments as running costs.)

## Personal life

The running costs for your **accommodation** depend on region/town you choose to live in - and of course on your personal preferences ![ðŸ˜‰](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tb0/1.5/16/1f609.png)

The **residency setup** costs depend on your citizenship and your willingness to invest time. As a EU-citizen you can get BG long term residency almost for free. (Authority fees are small.) But you might want to get some help anyway for translation/transliteration services. Still, the setup costs are low; usually <100â‚¬.

Should you be a non-EU citizen, though... things become more difficult. There are several ways to obtain a visa type D - but for most digital nomads we know in the end there's only one feasible option: a Blue Card. That's what [Nomad Nation's Resident plan](https://nomadnation.org/bulgaria/plans/resident.html?fbclid=IwAR0R8S6T9W6m8iPZevbsdlLv8ne9z4KWqp9EJrGH5cP_sdp3z0BOB001Uvg) is about. Unfortunately this option has a higher price tag because quite a bit of work is involved. Still, it's a 1-time cost.

## Business life

On the business cost side there are **1-time costs for getting your business registered** to yourself in BG. You can be self-employed (a freelancer) or have your own company. Both require interaction with the authorities and some fees. That's what the setup costs are about. You cannot avoid them - except when you choose one of our "hosted plans" and use Nomad Nation OOD as your cobusiness platform.

And then there are recurring costs - every month or annually - for being compliant and a good citizen ![ðŸ˜‰](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tb0/1.5/16/1f609.png) You cannot avoid taxes/social sec and you need a **tax accountant**. Don't try doing a tax declaration for Bulgaria at home ![ðŸ˜ƒ](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/taa/1.5/16/1f603.png)

Usually the accounting fees are depending on the type of business and the number of transactions (invoices, expense receipts). At Nomad Nation we're trying hard to cover you regarding this with competitive membership plan prices.

Unfortunately we can do nothing about your taxes and social security contributions. They depend on your profit and your payouts. Some options to optimize social security payments might exist, but overall the effect is limited. And we think that Bulgaria is very generous in this regard anyway, so it's hardly worthwhile to invest much into optimization. At least as the usual digital nomad not running a global business empire with billions of revenue ![ðŸ˜ƒ](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/taa/1.5/16/1f603.png)
