Scouting, boarding, cruising - that's the three phases of a homebase journey as we understand it at Nomad Nation.

## Phase 1: Scouting

Once you develop this feeling that a homebase is what you want, you start looking for the right place: country, region, city. You compile and compare data according to your criteria: the overall climate probably is of concern to you; then how close to nature you want to live; are you more a mountain or beach person; cost of living; local community of other digital nomads; how easy it is to get around with languages you speak; cost of living; cost of accommodation; taxes/social security rates; how difficult it is to gain residency at all; how to set up your business.

You travel around and check out different locations. Maybe coworking spaces are starting points for you.

## Phase 2: Boarding

From the data and experience you compiled in phase 1 you derive a decision. You commit yourself to migrate to a certain place to make it your homebase.

This has two sides:

- move towards that place, e.g. find permanent accomodation, get residency, set up your business

- move away from your previous homebase, let go of some part of your old life

Nomad Nation is focused on the first side of this commitment.

Boarding a country as the host of your new homebase can be quite a pain. You're no longer a visitor with little rights and obligations. You're becoming a resident with more rights and obligations. That means you have to go through application and registration processes. Things have to be made official. That's not fun in your home country, and it's not fun in a foreign country.

## Phase 3: Cruising

Finally, once you've overcome all the bureaucratic hurdles in your host country you can switch into cruising mode. You have a place you call home, you're a resident and allowed to do business. You are ready to earn money working from your new homebase.

## How Nomad Nation supports you on your journey

We at Nomad Nation want to help you in all phases.

- For a start we're trying to make it easier during boarding to become a resident (in Bulgaria for now). Next we're trying to take the pain out of getting your business running. That's what our membership plans are for.
- Also we're there during your cruise phase helping you to focus on your business and leave the bureaucratic stuff to the experts. That too is what our membership plans are for.

As happy as we are with the membership plans so far, we've work to do: better support for the scouting phase, more streamlined processes for the boarding phase, more tangibility for your business operation during the cruising phase.

Our vision is no less than making "setting up a homebase anywhere in the world" a commodity product for every solopreneur digital nomad ready for this change in her life.
